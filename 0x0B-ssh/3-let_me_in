# steps to do this task

1. Access your server
	ssh ubuntu@3.89.123.74

2. Switch to the ubuntu user
	sudo su - ubuntu

3. Create the .ssh directory (if it doesn't exist)
   in the ubuntu user's home directory
	mkdir -p ~/.ssh

4. Add the provided public key to `authorized_keys` file (if
   it doesn't exist create it in .ssh directory)
	echo "<the provided pub key>" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

5. Set the correct permissions for the authorized_keys file
	chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

6. Verify SSH access
	As you don't have the private key, the only way to confirm that the key
	was added correctly is to pass the checker.
